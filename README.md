CLI tool to execute shell commands in parallel.

Loosely based on [GNU parallel command](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/man.html).

# Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parallel):
```bash
$ npm install -g parallel
```

# Usage

```bash
parallel [options] [command [arguments]] < list_of_arguments

# Placeholders

```bash
{}     the input line
{.}    the input line without extension
{/}    the basename of the input line
{//}   the dirname of the input line
{/.}   the basename of the input line without extension
{#}    the sequence number of the job to run, [1,]
{%}    the job slot number [1, --jobs]
{..}   the input line without two extensions (e.g., file.tar.gz ‚Üí file)
{...}  the input line without up to three extensions (e.g., file.tar.gz.backup ‚Üí file)
{/..}  the basename without two extensions (e.g., path/file.tar.gz ‚Üí file)
{/...} the basename without three extensions (e.g., path/file.tar.gz.backup ‚Üí file)
{+/}   the number of "/" in the input line
{+.}   the number of "." in the input line
{n}    nth input column, followed by any operator above (f.e {2/.})
```

# Non-GNU placeholders

```bash
{ext}  the extension of the input line
{trim} the input line with leading/trailing whitespace removed
{v}    lower case the value
{^}    upper case the value
{t}    current time as a number
{T}    current time in ISO as a string
{d}    current date in ISO format
{r}    random number between 100000 and 999999
{md5}  MD5 hash of the input line
{len}  the length of the input line in characters
{wc}   the word count of the input line
```

# Input from command-line arguments

Input can be provided as command-line arguments preceeded by a `:::`.
Each argument will be considered a separate input line.
If you include several `:::`, parallel will use all the permutations between them as input lines.

You can also read arguments from files using `::::` followed by filenames.
This allows you to combine multiple input sources.

While GNU¬¥s version also permutates stdin and input files, this version won't.
You can also combine multiple input files with `::::` to create permutations.

Check examples (8), (10), (11), and (12) to see command-line input in action.

# Examples

## Basic Operations

```bash
# (1) Download files simultaneously 
echo -e "https://example.com/file1.zip\nhttps://example.com/file2.zip" | parallel curl -L {} -o downloads/{/}
```

```bash
# (2) Convert video files using all CPU cores
parallel ffmpeg -i {} -c:v libx264 converted/{.}.mp4 ::: *.avi
```

```bash
# (3) Compress large log files efficiently
find /var/log -name "*.log" -size +100M | parallel gzip {}
```

## Placeholders & File Processing

```bash
# (4) Demonstrate path manipulation placeholders
echo -e "/home/user/document.pdf\n/tmp/archive.tar.gz" | \
  parallel echo "Full: {} | Dir: {//} | File: {/} | Name: {/.} | Ext: {ext}"
```

```bash
# (5) Multi-extension removal (GNU --plus compatibility)
echo -e "project.tar.gz\nfile.min.js.map" | \
  parallel echo "File: {} | Remove 1: {.} | Remove 2: {..} | Remove 3: {...}"
```

```bash
# (6) Count characters in paths and filenames
echo -e "/deep/nested/path/file.min.js\nshallow.txt" | \
  parallel echo "File: {} | Slashes: {+/} | Dots: {+.} | Length: {len}"
```

## Column Processing & Data Manipulation

```bash
# (7) Process CSV data with column placeholders
echo -e "John,28,Engineer\nSarah,32,Designer" | \
  parallel -C ',' echo "Employee: {1} ({2} years old) works as {3}"
```

```bash
# (8) Clean whitespace from messy input
printf "  Alice  \n\t  Bob\t\n" | parallel echo "Original: '{}' | Cleaned: '{trim}'"
```

```bash
# (9) Transform text case and count words
echo -e "Hello World\nFOO BAR" | parallel echo "Text: {} | Lower: {v} | Upper: {^} | Words: {wc}"
```

## Job Management & Control

```bash
# (10) Preserve output order despite varying job times
seq 5 | parallel -k --shell "sleep \$((6 - {})); echo 'Job {} done'"
```

```bash
# (11) Limit concurrency and log job details
parallel -j 2 --joblog build.log echo 'Built {}' ::: app1 app2 app3
```

```bash
# (12) Tag output lines with their input source
echo -e "google.com\namazon.com" | parallel --tag ping -c 1 {}
```

## Advanced Features

```bash
# (13) Process large files in manageable chunks
cat huge_dataset.csv | parallel --pipe --block 10M --shell "wc -l"
```

```bash
# (14) Group multiple arguments per command  
echo -e "file1\nfile2\nfile3\nfile4" | parallel -X -j 1 echo "Processing batch:"
```

```bash
# (15) Randomize execution order for testing
seq 10 | parallel --shuf --dry-run echo 'Processing {}'
```

```bash
# (16) Generate combinations using structured input
echo -e "backup:database\narchive:config\nclone:source" | \
  parallel -C ':' echo "Operation {1} on {2}"
```

```bash
# (17) Use built-in time and random placeholders
parallel echo 'Job {} at {T} (ID: {r})' ::: task1 task2
```

# Command-line options
Once a command-line parameter that is not an option is found, then the "command" starts.
parallel supports command-line options in all these formats (all equivalent):
- `--trim --jobs 2`
- `--trim --jobs=2`
- `-t -j 2`
- `-tj 2`
- `-tj2`

# Exit code
Just like [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/man.html#EXIT-STATUS) does, the exit code will be the amount of jobs that failed (up to 101). It means that if any job fails, "global" exit code will be non-zero as well. You can add `--halt-on-error` to abort as soon as one job fails.

# Differences with [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/man.html)

## ‚úÖ **GNU Parallel Compatible Features**
- Full placeholder compatibility: `{..}`, `{...}`, `{/..}`, `{/...}`, `{+/}`, `{+.}`, etc.
- Standard options: `-t/--print-commands`, `--tag`, `--joblog`, `-k/--keep-order`, `--shuf`, `--block`
- File input: `::::` file syntax and `-a/--arg-file`
- Job control: `-X/--xargs`, `--halt-on-error`, `-p/--pipe`, `-D/--dry-run`

## üîß **Enhanced Features** 
- **Better defaults**: Default jobs = CPU count (not unlimited)
- **Input flexibility**: Supports piped input + `:::` arguments together (GNU doesn't)
- **Additional placeholders**: `{ext}`, `{v}`, `{^}`, `{t}`, `{T}`, `{d}`, `{r}`, `{md5}`, `{len}`, `{wc}`, `{trim}`
- **Simplified usage**: `--plus` not needed (features auto-enabled)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Simplified Behaviors**
- `--round-robin` is implicit when `--pipe` is used
- `--trim` only does full trim (no `<n|l|r|lr|rl>` options)
- `--halt-on-error` is binary (no complex exit condition options)
- No input permutation between `:::` and stdin/`--arg-file`
