parallel
=======

CLI tool to execute shell commands in parallel.

Loosely based on [GNU parallel command](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/man.html).

# Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parallel):
```bash
$ npm install -g parallel
```

# Usage

```bash
# Pass input lines as command-line arguments
input | parallel [options] cmd [cmd-options] {} > output

# Pipe input lines through the jobs stdin
input | parallel [options] --pipe cmd [cmd-options] > output
```

# Options

```bash
-j, --jobs <n>          Number of processes to spawn [default CPUs]
-n, --max-args <args>   Number of input lines per command line [default 1]
-d, --delimiter <delim> Input items are terminated by delim [default \n]
-0, --null              Use NUL as delimiter, alias for -d $'\\0'
-q, --quote             Quote each input line in case they contain special caracters
-t, --trim              Removes spaces, tabs and new lines around the input lines
-C, --colsep <regex>    Column separator for positional placeholders [default " "]
-a, --arg-file <file>   Use file as input source instead of stdin
-p, --pipe              Spread input lines to jobs via their stdin
-D, --dry-run           Print commands to run without running them, incompatible with --pipe
--bg                    Run commands in background and exit
--delay <secs>          Wait before starting new jobs, secs can be less than 1 [default 0]
--timeout <secs>        If the command runs longer than secs it gets killed with SIGTERM [default 0]
-v, --verbose           Output timing information to stderr
-s, --shell             Wrap command with shell (supports escaped pipes, redirection, etc.) [experimental]
--help                  Print this message and exit
--version               Print the comand version and exit
```

# Arguments placeholders

Unless `--pipe` is used, the input lines will be sent to jobs as command-line arguments. You can include placeholders and they will be replaced with each input line.
If no placeholder is found, input lines will be appended to the end as last arguments.
Everything around each placeholder will be repeated for each input line. Use quotes to include spaces or escape them with backslashes.

```
{}   input line
{.}  input line without extension
{/}  basename of the input line
{//} dirname of the input line
{/.} basename of the input line without extension
{n}  nth input column, followed by any operator above (f.e {2/.})
{#}  sequence number of the job to run [1, âˆž]
{%}  job slot number [1, --jobs]
```

# Examples

```bash
# Use all CPUs to grep a file
cat data.txt | parallel -p grep pattern > out.txt
```
```bash
# Use all CPUs to gunzip and concat files to a single file, 10 per process at a time
find . -name '*.gz' | parallel -n10 gzip -dc {} > out.txt
```
```bash
# Download files from a list, 10 at a time with all CPUs, use the URL basename as file name
cat urls.txt | parallel -j10 curl {} -o images/{/}
```
```bash
# Generate 100 URLs and download them with `curl` (uses experimental --shell option)
echo {001..100} | parallel -ts -d" " curl http://xyz.com/image_{}.png \> image_{}.png
```
```bash
# Rename extension from all txt to log
find . -name '*.txt' | parallel mv {} {.}.log
```
```bash
# Move each file to a subdir relative to their current dir
find . -type f | parallel mkdir -p {//}/sub && mv {} {//}/sub/{/}
```
```bash
# Showcase non-positional placeholders
find . -type f | parallel echo "file={} noext={.} base={/} base_noext={/.} dir={//} jobid={#} jobslot={%}"
```
```bash
# Showcase positional placeholders
echo A~B.ext~C~D | parallel -C '~' echo {4}+{3}+{2.}+{1}
```

# Command-line options
Once a command-line parameter that is not an option is found, then the "command" starts.
parallel supports command-line options in all these formats (all equivalent):
- `--trim --jobs 2`
- `--trim --jobs=2`
- `-t -j 2`
- `-tj 2`
- `-tj2`

# Differences with [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/man.html)
- Added aliases to some options: `-p` -> `--pipe`, `-D` -> `--dry-run`
- `--round-robin` is implicit when `--pipe` is used
- `--max-args=0` here means distribute all input lines evenly among `--jobs`
- `--shell` was added to allow pipes, redirection, etc
- `--trim` doesn't support `<n|l|r|lr|rl>`, it trims all spaces, tabs and newlines from both sides
- A ton of missing options that I consider less useful
- Some placeholders aren't supported
- Many more

# ToDo
- Support more options from [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/man.html)
- Support more [placeholders](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/man.html#OPTIONS)
- Implement backpressure to pause input if output is overwhelmed
- Show help when nothing is piped in, `process.stdin.isTTY` not working as expected
- Support `--header` working with CSV-like files
- Support `--jobs=0` for unlimited. Easy except when piping or when `--max-args=0`
- Should default behavior of -n 0 only happen if -m or -xargs, like on GNU?
- Use [node-shell-quote](https://github.com/substack/node-shell-quote) for `--dry-run` and `--shell`?
- Clean up `jobs` module, maybe create a `job` module with some of its logic
- Maybe support `:::` and `::::`, seems pointless
- Maybe avoid pre-spawning jobs when piping. Spawn on demand when overwhelmed, support `--delay` there too
- Support multiple `-a`? can be achieved with `cat a b c` though, maybe it's pointless
